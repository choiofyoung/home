        <h1>Types Of Puzzles</h1>
        <p>
            There are many, many puzzles out there, but what I will be covering is some of the common cubes that can officially have a world record for. In other words, all of these puzzles are officially recognized by the World Cube Association. There are a total of 11 puzzles, but I will be mentioning 4 unique ones.
        </p>
        <h2>The 11 Puzzles</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>2x2</li>
            <li>3x3</li>
            <li>4x4</li>
            <li>5x5</li>
            <li>6x6</li>
            <li>7x7</li>
            <li>Clock</li>
            <li>Megaminx</li>
            <li>Pyraminx</li>
            <li>Skewb</li>
            <li>Square-1</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>The Pyraminx</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="pyraminx.jpg" alt="Pyraminx" width="300">A puzzle called a pyraminx is actually in the shape of a pyramid. It was originally invented by Uwe M&egrave;ffert in the 1970s, and then brought it to Hong Kong to mass produce it in 1981. 
        </p>
        <h2>The Skewb</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="skewb.jpeg" alt="Skewb" width="300">The skewb turns in a very unique <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DPrenPlUE4&ab_channel=RedKB">way</a>. It was originally invented by Tony Durham and was marketed by Uwe M&egrave;ffert. In december 2013, the World Cube Association recognized it as an official event.
        </p>
        <h2>The Megaminx</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="megaminx.jpg" alt="Megaminx" width="300">This puzzle is called a megaminx. Essentially, it's just the 3x3 cube on 12 sides, making it deceptively easy. The way you solve it is solving all the sides just like a regular 3x3, so for the most part, this puzzle is actually intuitive.
        </p>
        <h2>The Clock</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="clock.jpg" alt="Clock" width="300"> This is the only non-turnable puzzle recognized by the World Cube Association. To solve it, you turn the 4 dials on the corners and press the 4 yellow buttons to make the dials all point at <a href="https://youtu.be/pb0LJKTHzEc">12:00</a>.
